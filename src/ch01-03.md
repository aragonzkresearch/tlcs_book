## Security
Our system reiles on the the well-known League of Entropy randomness beacon, drand.love. In addition, a single honest party participating in the computation of the public key is enough to ensure that the private key cannot be uncovered ahead of time. In order to increase security even further, we will allow public participation during the private key preparation phase.

For formal security proof of the protocol read this [section](https://).
