## How It Works?

Choose your preferred cryptographic scheme and a future day (up to 10 years in advance) or hour (up to 2 years in advance) and obtain a public key. You can now encrypt your data and safely share it with others, knowing it can only be decrypted at the specified time in the future, when the corresponding private key will be published on timelock.zone.
